# RealEstateMogul
Simple android application that is based on the widely recognised incremental game 'Cookie Clicker'. This application was developed
for the 'Engineering Mobile Applications' module within my final year of University.

*The game works by the user pressing the coin icon, each press generates Â£1 of currency. When the user has enough currency they can buy
properties that generate a specific amount of currency each second. Each time a property is purchased the price rises.*
